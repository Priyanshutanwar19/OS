 Efficient Garbage Collection in OS - Simulation Project

Explore how operating systems manage memory efficiently with our interactive simulation of the Mark and Sweep algorithm. This project offers a clear visualization of how memory blocks are allocated, marked, and collected. Experience it in action and gain insights into garbage collection in operating systems.
